user: [Tue 2026-02-03 22:15 GMT+7] verify e2e test updated?
[message_id: 2d5a5607-c956-4640-afa9-45e29893b90e]
assistant: ✅ **E2E Tests Verified - All 24 Passing!**

No updates needed to E2E tests. They check:
- English booth names (Registration, Ignite Stage, etc.) ✅
- Button text patterns (`/สแตมป์เลย!/`) ✅
- UI elements (profile, progress bar, navigation) ✅

The Thai text change (`รอประกัน` → `รอประทับ`) doesn't affect E2E tests since they don't validate the Thai subtitles.

**Test Results:**
```
24 passed (8.2s)

Chromium:        12 ✅
Mobile Chrome:   12 ✅
```

**All tests up to date!** 🎯
