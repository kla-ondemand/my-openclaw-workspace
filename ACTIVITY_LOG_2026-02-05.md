| Developer | Ta | 2002 | Male | **The Regenerator** | Improvement, problem-solving |
| Developer | Off | 2000 | Male | **The Architect** | System design, structure |

### Type Distribution Analysis

| Type | Count | % | Description |
|------|-------|---|-------------|
| **The Architect** | 4 | 40% | Heavy on system/structure - good for technical foundation |
| **The Regenerator** | 3 | 30% | Strong improvement/quality focus - iterative excellence |
| **The Guide** | 2 | 20% | Leadership/coordination - direction setting |
| **The Gardener** | 1 | 10% | Growth mindset - team nurturing |
| **Artist** | 0 | 0% | ⚠️ Gap: Innovation, wild ideas, experimentation |
| **Adventurer** | 0 | 0% | ⚠️ Gap: Risk-taking, new tech exploration |
| **Warrior** | 0 | 0% | ⚠️ Gap: Execution pressure, deadline driving |

### Key Insights

**Strengths:**
- Strong technical foundation (4 Architects including Tonkla)
- Continuous improvement culture (3 Regenerators)
- Clear leadership direction (2 Guides)
- Good for iterative development and quality focus

**Gaps (Critical for High-Performance Teams):**
- **No Artist** - May lack breakthrough innovation, experimental thinking
- **No Adventurer** - May be conservative with new technology adoption
- **No Warrior** - May struggle with deadline pressure and aggressive execution

### Recommendations

1. **If no Warrior found:** Games (Director/Guide) should drive deadlines more aggressively
2. **If no Artist found:** Encourage Phear (Gardener) to explore creative/experimental ideas
3. **Team balance:** Consider adding an Artist or Adventurer for innovation injection
4. **Leverage strengths:** Use the high Architect count for system design phases

### Communication Strategy

- **With Architects:** Focus on structure, planning, system design
- **With Regenerators:** Frame as improvements, quality enhancements
- **With Guides:** Provide vision context, strategic alignment
- **With Gardener:** Emphasize team growth, skill development
